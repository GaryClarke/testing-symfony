# ðŸ§ª Testing Symfony â€“ Course Project

Welcome to the official repo for the **Testing Symfony** section of the [Testing PHP: Laravel & Symfony course](https://www.garyclarke.tech/p/testing-php-laravel-symfony) by [Gary Clarke](https://www.garyclarke.tech).

This project begins with a clean Symfony 7 install and evolves step-by-step throughout the course into a fully testable Symfony application. Youâ€™ll follow along as we build a job application system and apply real-world testing techniques using Symfony's test client, PHPUnit, and mocking strategies.
